title: About
---

My name is Matthieu Laneuville, currently Assistant Professor at the [Earth-Life Science
Institute](http://elsi.jp/en/), from the [Tokyo Institute of
Technology](http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/), Japan.

My focus is the long term evolution of terrestrial bodies: Mercury's contraction history, the
asymmetric evolution of our Moon, the deep Earth interior are example of my projects.
 
Within [ELSI](http://elsi.jp/en/) I have recently started to work on global thermodynamics and
chemical evolution of the Earth, specifically trying to assess the importance of the biosphere. This
has implications for our understanding of the Earth as a system and the understanding of general
planetary evolution.
