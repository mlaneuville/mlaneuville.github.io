I spend most of my time worrying about the evolution of our Moon, and more precisely, the origin of
the anomalous KREEP region on the lunar nearside. I am more generally interested in the interior
evolution of the terrestrial planets. As part of my position at [ELSI](http://elsi.jp/en/) I have
started to investigate a few aspects of the Earth-Life interactions. I also try to get involved in
planetary mission planning.
