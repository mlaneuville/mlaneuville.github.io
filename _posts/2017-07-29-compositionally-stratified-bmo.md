title: Crystallization of a compositionally stratified BMO
type: paper
---

Here we studied the implication of a stratified basal magma ocean (BMO) on the 
evolution of Earth's core. Stratifications can arise from early differentiation 
and it has a strong influence on the heat flow out of the core and hence, on 
magnetic field generation.
