title: Inner core crystallization as a power source for lunar dynamo
type: talk
---

Presentation given as part of the conference: "Advances in lunar magnetism: from
paleomagnetism to dynamos" in Cargese, France, June 1-3, 2016.

The main purpose of this presentation was to show how global mantle history
controls magnetic field generation for the Moon, in particular the effect of
KREEP enrichment on the nearside and the potential mantle overturn.

The effect of different light elements on dynamo generation was also presented.

Example output for simulations with an increasing (from left to right) initial
amount of sulfur (red) or carbon (green). For a given dynamo onset time, carbon
alloys can sustain longer activity. This is due to the relative slow core growth
with core cooling.
