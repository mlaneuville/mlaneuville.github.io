title: The language of exoplanet ranking metrics needs to change
type: paper
---

Opinion piece by Tasker et al. to discuss current use of ranking metrics in the 
scientific community and in the media. We argue that over-simplifying the 
concept of 'Earth-like' or 'habitability' while data is still ambiguous is 
damaging to the field. This is an output from the Planetary Diversity workshop 
help at ELSI a few months earlier.

The paper can be found in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0042) or on the [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.01363.pdf).
