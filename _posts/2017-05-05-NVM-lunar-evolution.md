title: Distribution of radioactive heat sources and magnetic field
type: talk
---

We present new constraints on radioactive heat sources distribution in the lunar 
interior and their implications for long term evolution and in particular 
magnetic field generation. This was part of the [New Views of the Moon 
2](https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/newviews2017/) workshop held just after the 
[European Lunar Symposium](https://els2017.arc.nasa.gov/) in Muenster, Germany.
