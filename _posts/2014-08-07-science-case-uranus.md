Giant planets helped to shape the conditions we see in the Solar System today and they account for
more than 99% of the mass of the Sun’s planetary system. They can be subdivided into the Ice Giants
(Uranus and Neptune) and the Gas Giants (Jupiter and Saturn), which differ from each other in a
number of fundamental ways. Uranus, in particular is the most challenging to our understanding of
planetary formation and evolution, with its large obliquity, low self-luminosity, highly
asymmetrical internal field, and puzzling internal structure. 

Uranus also has a rich planetary system consisting of a system of inner natural satellites and
complex ring system, five major natural icy satellites, a system of irregular moons with varied
dynamical histories, and a highly asymmetrical magnetosphere. Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to
have explored Uranus, with a flyby in 1986, and no mission is currently planned to this enigmatic
system. However, a mission to the uranian system would open a new window on the origin and evolution
of the Solar System and would provide crucial information on a wide variety of physicochemical
processes in our Solar System.  These have clear implications for understanding exoplanetary
systems. 

In this paper we describe the science case for an orbital mission to Uranus with an atmospheric
entry probe to sample the composition and atmospheric physics in Uranus’ atmosphere. The
characteristics of such an orbiter and a strawman scientific payload are described and we discuss
the technical challenges for such a mission. This paper is based on a white paper submitted to the
European Space Agency’s call for science themes for its large-class mission programme in 2013.
