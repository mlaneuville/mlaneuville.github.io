>Cleaves, Laneuville and Virgo, work in progress.

The fluxes of various elements between planetary reservoirs on the prebiotic
Earth may have changed considerably during the course of the planet's evolution.
While much attention has been paid to the prebiotic C-cycle, especially due to
its potential role in greenhouse warming, relatively little has been paid to the
prebiotic N-cycle. 

The amount of N in various reservoirs could have been markedly different in the
past, and may have changed over time. Assuming chondritic values, the Earth' s
total N inventory should be ~2e22 kg. Presently, ~4e21 kg are in the atmosphere,
so either 90% of Earth's N is in deep reservoirs, large amounts of N have been
lost over time, or the Earth is largely non-chondritic. Dissolving all
atmospheric N or the entire chondritic inventory in oceans of the modern volume
gives maximal oceanic (N) of 0.1 and 1 M, respectively, which would be quite
conducive to prebiotic synthesis. 

The Earth system prior to ~3.5 Ga is poorly constrained but b iology has
undoubtedly significantly perturbed the Earth’s N-cycle. Presently, the flux
of N from the atmosphere is dominated by biology, followed distantly by
abiotic fixation by lightning. Biological N-cycling is tight, both fixing
N from the atmosphere more rapidly than abiotic mechanisms, and also
returning it to the atmosphere efficiently. In the absence of efficient
remineralization, all of the N in the present atmosphere, given current
rates of abiotic fixation, could be depleted in ~175 Ma. 

Here we present preliminary results of a prebiological Earth -system model which
takes into account atmospheric, atmosphere-ocean, ocean-sediment, and subduction
processes and reservoirs to estimate the nature of Earth’s N-cycle before life
began. Our model may help place constraints on the early and evolution of the
abiological N-cycle. 

The figure below shows the reservoirs and fluxes that we take into account
(suffix 0, 1 and 2 corresponds to N2, oxidized and reduced nitrogen).
