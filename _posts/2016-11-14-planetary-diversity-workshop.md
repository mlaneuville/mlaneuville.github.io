Along with Lena Noack (Royal Observatory of Belgium), Johanna Teske (Carnegie 
Institution) and Cayman Unterborn (Arizona State University), we organized full 
week workshop to discuss about strategies to understand planetary diversity in 
the context of the new exoplanetary dataset.

Participants had a wide range of backgrounds in order to understand key 
assumptions within each fields and build a common understanding. More details 
can be found
[here](http://www.elsi.jp/en/research/activities/workshops/2016/11/20161114eon.html).

Discussions at the workshop also lead to the publication of an 
[article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0042) 
discussing the (de)merit of habitability metrics in Nature Astronomy (can also 
be found on arxiv).
