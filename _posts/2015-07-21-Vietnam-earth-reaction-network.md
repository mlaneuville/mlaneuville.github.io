title: 11th Rencontres du Vietnam &middot Atmospheric disequilibria
type: talk

>Laneuville, Foriel, Fujii, Virgo, work in progress.

This one week workshop was aimed at finding synergistic ways to study planetary systems. We
presented ways to understand disequilibrium in planetary atmospheres in terms of available free
energy and fluxes.

We found that total disequilibrium (difference between free energy and minimal free energy) provides
limited information about a planet compared to free energy fluxes. We considered the rate of
dissipation/generation of the free energy on the Earth and Mars to make that point.

Next steps will include a study of how free energy flows in the complete earth reaction network.
