title: Stratifications and Magnetic Field Generation
type: talk
---

During the Interaction and Coevolution of the Core and Mantle 2017 
[workshop](http://en.core-mantle.jp/archives/493) I presented an updated on 
recent work we've being doing at ELSI on stratifications and magnetic fields 
generation.

In particular I talked about Earth's basal magma ocean (work already published, 
see [here]({% post_url 2017-07-29-compositionally-stratified-bmo %})) and the 
Martian dynamo (work in progress).
