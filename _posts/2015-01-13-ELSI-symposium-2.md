The hierarchical organization of biological systems appears to derive from transitions in the units
of individuality that represent singular points in the evolutionary process. Fundamental to these
are competing selective forces operating at diã„¦ent levels of organization. During such
transitions, the structure of and thus manner in which information is encoded in chemical or
biological systems undergoes what is analogous to the phase transitions of statistical physics. The
evolution of multicellularity is one of the most striking examples of such a transition in biology.

We study a simple stochastic model where isolated communities of interacting unicellular organisms
undergo a transition to multicellularity. This transition is indicated by the marked decrease in
the number of cells utilized to generate new communities from pre-existing ones. In this sense, the
community begins to reproduce as a whole via a decreasing number of cells. While this transition
is feasible in its absence, the presence of horizontal gene transfer drastically reduces the fitness
barrier to the occurrence of such a transition. 

Together, these features capture from a statistical and mechanistic perspective two of the most
prominent aspects of the transition to multicellularity: the evolution of a developmental process
and reproduction through a unicellular bottleneck.
