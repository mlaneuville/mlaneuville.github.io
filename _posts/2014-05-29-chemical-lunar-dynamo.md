The lunar magnetic field is both too strong and too long. Its estimated amplitude 4 Ga ago is
similar to that of the Earth at the present day, which is hard to conciliate with the fact that its
core is about 10 times smaller than that of the Earth. The duration of its activity also seem to be
longer than what could easily be explained by a thermal dynamo running from the primordial heat of
accretion.

In recent years many studies have tackled the issue, including mechanically driven dynamos which
could be triggered by impact or orbital evolution and chemically driven dynamos. We have studied the
strength of the dynamo generated by chemical buoyancy due to crystallization of the inner core. We
found that it could explain a very long lasting magnetic field at the lunar surface. However, other
studies have since shown that with a full treatment of the growth rate, the long lasting magnetic
field is no longer produced.

There is thus much work still to be done to understand both these aspect of the lunar magnetic
history. The most promising being probably the mechanically driven dynamo due to the evolution of
the orbital parameters.
